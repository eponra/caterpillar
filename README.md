# caterpillar
caterpillar is a family of fanducts, that all share the same feature, which is using CF rods for directing air to the part.

This is still a Work in Progress, and was mainly developed to fit on my foldable printer, but will also be adapted in the end, to fit
all my other 3D printers.

Here you see a few of the models i designed and printed (i havent kept every version):

Here we see 3 3010 blowers, and one 4010 blower, mounted to the prototypes.
